# HR-Workforce-Analytics-Attrition-Retention-Dashboard-Tableau-
A Tableau dashboard providing key insights into workforce dynamics. It tracks Attrition Rate, Employee Demographics, and Job Satisfaction to identify high-risk departments (like R&amp;D) and age groups. This project supports HR leaders in developing targeted employee retention strategies.


## Project Summary

This project showcases a comprehensive Tableau dashboard designed to give HR leaders and departmental managers an immediate, actionable view of workforce health. It shifts the focus from reactive reporting to proactive talent management by visualizing key drivers of employee turnover.
The primary goal is to identify and mitigate attrition risk across demographic groups, departments, and job satisfaction levels.


## Business Problem Solved

The organization lacked a centralized tool to quickly link employee turnover with specific causes (departmental stress, low job satisfaction, age demographics). This resulted in slow, costly, and ineffective retention efforts. This dashboard closes that gap, enabling strategic intervention before employees submit their notice.


## Key Analytical Insights

The visualizations provide actionable answers for HR strategy:
- Risk Mitigation: The R&D Department shows a disproportionately high attrition rate (56.12% of total attrition), marking it as the highest-priority area for management review.
- Volatile Age Group: The 25âˆ’34 Age Group contributes the highest volume to the attrition count, indicating a critical vulnerability in retaining junior to mid-level talent.
-Satisfaction Check: By cross-referencing Job Role and Job Satisfaction Rating, managers can isolate specific roles (e.g., Research Scientist, Sales Executive) where turnover is occurring despite moderate satisfaction scores, pointing to issues beyond just happiness (like workload or career path).
- Education Field Impact: Employees from the Life Sciences education background show the highest volume of attrition (89), suggesting a competitive talent market for this specific skill set.


## Tools & Technical Skills

- **Tableau Desktop**
- Techniques: Creation of custom calculated fields for the Attrition Rate, effective use of dashboard actions and filters, and structuring data into clear, segmented visualizations (pie charts, bar charts, heatmaps) for maximum impact.
- Focus: Strong data storytelling by visually connecting cause (satisfaction, age) to effect (attrition count).
